# Introduction 

This document houses a list of resources I've put together that have helped me in my journey from novice R user to experienced (kinda) R package developer. Most of the resources will be centered around developing packages specifically, but some pertain to other types of R projects. 

# Package Development 

- [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org)
  - The official R package development book, written by Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan. Contains a startup guide and sections on metadata, dependencies, unit testing, and documentation. Good comprehensive resource, but not the quickest way to get up & running. This package does have non-R dependencies, but they're free & easy to install.  

- [The `{usethis}` package](https://usethis.r-lib.org)
  - This R package removes a lot of headaches from setting up a new R package or other project. It contains functions to [create a new R package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/create_package.html), [set up continuous integration (CI) tools](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#continuous-integration), [connect your package to a GitHub repository](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github.html), and much more. Essentially, it removes a lot of the point-and-click steps that used to be necessary to set up an R package & get it version-controlled, and generally just makes development a lot easier. 

# Computational Efficiency 

- [Code profiling with `{proffer}`](https://r-prof.github.io/proffer/)
  - Code profiling allows you to see a breakdown in graph or table form of which functions in a piece of code are taking the longest to execute. This is done at varying hierarchical levels of resolution, which means you can see that e.g., a function you wrote called `run_analysis()` is taking up 50% of your computation time, and that within that function the main culprit is the subfunction `load_large_dataset()`. As such, it becomes very simple & quick to identify the best targets for further optimization of your code with respect to runtime. 
  
- [Benchmarking runtime using `{microbenchmark}`](https://www.statology.org/r-microbenchmark/)
  - This package is a very light benchmarking utility. It allows you to compare a list of different functions' runtime by executing each function a given number of times e.g., 100 times, and returning the distribution of runtime for each function. This makes it very easy to quickly see which implementation of a given task is better with respect to runtime. The source repository can be found [here](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/microbenchmark). 

# Reproducible Research 

- [Reproducible pipelines in R using `{targets}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)
  - The `{targets}` package is one of my favorite R tools, & the well-written docs above show how to create version-controlled pipelines entirely using R. This framework is an absolute godsend for large projects, simulation studies, etc., and I've used it on every longterm computational project I've worked on in the past 2 years. It makes tracking, reproducing, & parallelizing the execution of large codebases very easy, and makes reproducible research accessible to anyone with a good handle on R.  

# Development Best Practices

- [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/index.html)
  - This online book is less about package development & more about R's idiosyncrasies, but it contains a bunch of useful tips & tricks on how to make your code more reproducible & less brittle. The debugging section is clear & concise, and contains links to other, more detailed resources as well. 

# Miscellaneous 

- [The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf)
  - This amusingly-titled & engagingly-written book covers a variety of oddities & frustrating idiosyncrasies that R has, many of which are holdovers from when R was being first developed. If you're having an annoyingly difficult low-level problem, this book might have the answer.
