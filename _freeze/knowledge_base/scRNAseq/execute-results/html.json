When possible, I'll link to static versions of things in the hopes that links don't break. I'll categorize resources according to which problem they address e.g., raw data processing, clustering, visualization, etc., though some resources will of course touch on multiple topics.  \n\n# Introductory Guides \n\n- [Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/)\n  - This book is a thoroughly comprehensive guide on using Bioconductor tools built around the `SingleCellExperiment` data structure to perform scRNA-seq analysis. It covers basic & advanced versions everything from quality control to many different types of downstream analyses in both the single- and multi-sample cases. \n  \n- [`Seurat` guided clustering tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)\n  - The famous `Seurat` PBMC3k vignette that everyone has looked at at least once. Useful for beginners to get an idea of how `Seurat` works, but glosses over a ton of details & makes things look perhaps a bit too easy. \n\n# Processing Raw Reads \n\n- [10XGenomics `cellranger` documentation](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/installation)\n  - Shows how to use the official `cellranger` pipeline maintained by 10X to turn your raw reads into a gene-cell counts matrix. \n\n- [Quantifying unspliced & spliced RNA with `alevin-fry`](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-fry-tutorials/2021/alevin-fry-velocity/)\n  - Use this pipeline if you want to perform RNA velocity analysis, or just want to have your read counts quantified by spliced / unspliced / ambiguous status (called `USA` mode in the documentation).\n\n- [`kallisto | bustools` documentation](https://www.kallistobus.tools)\n  - This command line tool & Python downstream analysis suite are maintained by the Pachter Lab and are very well-written. This framework also allows for unspliced vs. spliced RNA count quantification, which is necessary to run RNA velocity. I would recommend reading through the docs just for the tips on scRNA-seq analysis even if you don't end up using the tool. \n\n# Quality Control \n\n- [Vignette for `Seurat` cell cycle score](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/cell_cycle_vignette.html)\n  - Uses regression to assign a S- and G2M-phase score to each cell based on human cell cycle genes from [this 2019 paper](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad0501). \n\n# Normalization \n\n- [`SCnorm`: Robust normalization of single cell data](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4263)\n\n- [Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1)\n  - This paper details `SCTransform`, a Satija Lab method for normalization that uses regularized negative binomial GLMs to model gene expression variance while accounting for overdispersion & sharing information across genes. There's been some controversy over where this method is actually that good, such as [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02451-7) which posits that the `SCTransform` model is overspecified, and recommends the usage of GLM-PCA as proposed [here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1861-6). \n  - [Original `SCTransform` vignette ](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/sctransform_vignette.html) & [`SCTransform` V2 vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/sctransform_v2_vignette.html) with methodological improvements. \n\n# Integration \n\n# Clustering \n\n# Annotation \n\n# Dimension Reduction & Visualization \n\n# Trajectory Inference\n\n## Via Pseudotime\n\n## Via RNA Velocity\n\n- [RNA velocity unravaled](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010492)\n\n- [On the mathematics of RNA velocity I: Theoretical analysis](https://doi.org/10.4208/csiam-am.SO-2020-0001)\n\n# Differential Expression \n\n# Pathway Analysis \n\n- [Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM): a fast and accurate method for cell-specific gene set scoring](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa582)\n   - `VAM` is an easy-to-use method for assigning each cell in a sample a score bounded on $[0, 1]$ for a user-provided gene set of interest. It's conveniently wrapped around the `Seurat` framework, and I've found it to be accurate & useful in my single cell work. In addition, the author was very helpful when I reached out to him with some questions when I was first starting out. Vignettes can be found [here](https://hrfrost.host.dartmouth.edu/VAM/). \n\n# Simulation\n\n- [Enhancing biological signals and detection rates in single-cell RNA-seq experiments with cDNA library equalization ](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1071)\n   - This paper details the `{scaffold}` simulation method & accompanying R package ([detailed vignette here](https://www.rhondabacher.com/scaffold-vignette.pdf)) built by my PhD adviser Dr. Rhonda Bacher. scRNA-seq data simulation can often be tricky, and most packages have weird defaults, don't generate data that follows true scRNA-seq count distributions, or are just really hard to set up & use. `{scaffold}` fixes all that, and allows the user to generate UMI or non-UMI data, as well as data containing multiple populations or dynamic trends over pseudotime. Ground truth cluster labels and cell temporal orderings are provided, which makes it a great choice when benchmarking new or extant methods. It's fairly simple to use, & computationally efficient as well which is a huge plus when running large simulation studies. \n\n# Computational Reproducibility & Scalability \n\n- [Reproducible pipelines in R using `{targets}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)\n  - The `{targets}` package is one of my favorite R tools, & the well-written docs above show how to create version-controlled pipelines entirely using R. This framework is an absolute godsend for large projects, simulation studies, etc., and I've used it on every longterm computational project I've worked on in the past 2 years. It makes tracking, reproducing, & parallelizing the execution of large codebases very easy, and makes reproducible research accessible to anyone with a good handle on R.  \n\n- [Parallelization in `Seurat` vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/future_vignette.html)\n  - Shows usage of the `future` R package to improve tasks such as normalization, integration, clustering, & differential expression. \n\n# Miscellaneous \n\n",
