I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Florida under Dr. Rhonda Bacher. My primary research interest is single cell RNA-seq computational method development, specifically with respect to clustering, trajectory inference, and differential expression. I'm passionate about scientific reproducibility, computational scalability, and interpretable inference.
