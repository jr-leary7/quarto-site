I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Florida under Dr. Rhonda Bacher. My primary research interest are genomics and genetics, and particularly single cell RNA-seq computational method development. I mostly develop tools related to clustering, trajectory inference, and differential expression analysis. In addition, I also focus on scientific reproducibility, computational scalability, and interpretable inference.
